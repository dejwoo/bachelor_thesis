\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Hardware}
Develop an embedded device which will be running operating system of your preference. Integrate this device with needed addons to operate properly such as Internet, Wi-Fi, GPS and additional sensors. Figure out how to connect your device to the vehicle's OBD-II service port. Make sure device and sensors are connected correctly so you would not get errorous data. Test your hardware for correct measurments/information, to be sure it is not defect.
\subsection{System}
Configure operating system to every sensoric input so you can communicate with them. Use any protocol for communication which will suit your solution. Develop a main application server which will be responsible for reading input information, parsing this data to objects and storing them into database. This server will have modular capabilities of connecting various sources of information. Develop a protocol which will enable to configure comunication between server and inputs. Your server should accept data in predefined format which will be provided by input functions. Create an interface where user can configure this input functions to increase adaptivity of your system. Figure out how to storage parsed data, keep in mind that this database will need to be compact as you do not have unlimited space on your device. For accessing information from the Internet and WiFi, create RESTful web application which will enable authorized user to access your web app. In web application add a configuration webpage where user can easily configure your system. Add behavior modes which will enable user to set prefered methods of communicating over the Internet. e.g. you are connected not on your home network so roaming charges apply, add setting which will enable or disable reporting of choosen data-sets based on preference of the user. Parameters which user should be able to configure are: rate of collecting information from various inputs, SMS contact numbers and text which should be send in case of accident, POST medthods to supplied url addresses of choosen data sets.
\subsection{Application}
Provide an application which will utilize information collected from connected vehilce. The application needs to preform logic deduction from accessed data and act upon it. First application will  be accident detection/prevention. This application will access statistical database of accidents, look up how many of accidents happened in the location where vehicle is. Get an statistical average of accidents happening in nearby area, compare this results and if vehicle is passing trough area which has higher chance of beiing in a accident, infrom driver of hazardous conditions. Design a system which will detect if accident happend, by active monitoring accelerometer data. Figure out threshold value which needs to be triggered for correct detecting of accident. Simulate this events. After accident is detected, send an SMS/email to recepient depending on the settings in a system aplication, with contact information of the driver and car's location. Second application will create statistical map of cars running on low fuel. Devlop a way how to get/compute fuel level in fuel tank, monitor this level and after certain threshold, report GPS position of car to the statistical map.ars which has low fuel. Add to the statistical map a real-time data for reporting cars which have low fuel level in fuel tank. This real-time map will be used to monitor behaviour of drivers with low fuel, where they tend to fuel up and how long they kept fuel on low level. Log this data and analyze it.

\subsection{Output}
Output of your bachelor thesis should be application which upon correct instalation on embedded device is capable of monitoring various inputs of sensoric data, log them and make them accessible for different services through Internet, reaserch what is more suitable, store collected information on embedded device which provides user of control over what is shared and what is not or store it on cloud based service where the provider collecting this data can make better data analysis on gathered information and use it.
