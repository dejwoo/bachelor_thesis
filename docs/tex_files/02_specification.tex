\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Hardware}
We will d an embedded device which will be running operating system of your preference. Design how to connect all peripheral devices.Setup the device with applications to operate properly such as Internet, Wi-Fi, GPS and additional sensors. Figure out how to connect your device to the vehicle's OBD-II service port. Assamble and provide this device as a hardware part of this bachelor thesis.
\subsection{System}
Configure the system to every sensoric input so you can communicate with them. Use any protocol for communication which will suit your solution. Develop a application for collecting information from various sources, design the system to be easily configurable, without needing to change large portions of the system. System will have modular capabilities of connecting various sources of information. Develop a routing which will enable to configure which way data flows from input sources to output sinks. Design the application for modular adding of different outputs. Define a format in which are information passed from your server. Create an interface where user can configure this input functions to increase adaptivity of your system. Figure out how to send data to the server connected to the Internet. For accessing through WiFi, create RESTful web application which will user to access your web app. In web application add a configuration webpage where user can easily configure your system. Parameters of modules connected to your application will have to be configurable by the user, define them and provide a configuration method.
\subsection{Application}
Provide examples which will utilize your modular application, gathering information collected from connected vehilce. The examples needs to preform logic deduction from accessed data and act upon it.
\subsection{Output}
Output of your bachelor thesis should be application which upon correct instalation on embedded device is capable of monitoring various inputs of sensoric data, based upon configuration distribute and make them accessible for different services.
