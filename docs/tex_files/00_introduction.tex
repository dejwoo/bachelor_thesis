Most of us who watched Knight Rider as a kid expected that by 2015 we would be driving self-aware cars like KITT - cars that would drive us without problems from point A to point B while entertaining us. However we can resort to that this is only partially true, we have successful tries at completely autonomous cars(e.g Googleâ€™s car) but for ordinary costumer they are not available. What is available is connected cars. Connected cars provide the possibility of internet-based transfer of information. This can be obtained either with embedded devices in car or smartphone. Multiple car manufacturers sell connected cars where different OEM(Original Equipment Manufacturer) devices or applications. These OEMs offer various services which are provided to you when you purchase their car, but there is a small problem. Often these OEM devices have been designed to work with applications provided from car manufacturer and it is not possible to use other applications to gather information from the car. You can not configrue them to the extent as smartphones have apps. It is either you will get used to your OEM solution or go and buy whole solution from somebody else. It is like we are stuck in the 90s, where software offered to you had come on this particular hardware and you could not choose otherwise.  Imagine you would buy smartphone with predifined set of applications and you could not change them or add new. To sum it up, new connected cars lack easy configuration of information gathering, using this information according to wishes of customer not car manufacturer. So in my thesis I would like provide solution for these problems, build a device which will be capable of collecting information and act based on it. You can follow my thesis to gain insight into how to connect car and what possible services you might obtain for yourself. In first chapter I will establish some common ground on which we can build foundations of this thesis. In next step I will describe the specification of problem, design a solution for it, and show implementation of the solution to this given task.
